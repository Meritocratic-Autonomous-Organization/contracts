1Hive's Token Request app allows users to create a vote which requests an Organization's tokens in exchange for payment. For example a user may request minting 100 organization tokens in exchange for 100 DAI. The request would require a vote to approve, if the vote is rejected the user would receive their payment back and if it is approved the payment would be deposited in the organization's vault.
